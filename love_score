# This is a program that tests the compatibility between two people.
# To work out the love score between two people:
# Take both people's names and check for the number of times the letters in the word TRUE occurs.
# Then check for the number of times the letters in the word LOVE occurs.
# Then combine these numbers to make a 2 digit number.
# For Love Scores less than 10 or greater than 90, the message should be: "Your score is *x*, you go together like coke and mentos."
# For Love Scores between 40 and 50, the message should be: "Your score is *y*, you are alright together."
# Otherwise, the message will just be their score. e.g.: "Your score is *z*."

# Examples:

name1 = "Angela Yu"
name2 = "Jack Bauer"

T occurs 0 times

R occurs 1 time

U occurs 2 times

E occurs 2 times

Total = 5

L occurs 1 time

O occurs 0 times

V occurs 0 times

E occurs 2 times

Solution
============

def love_score(name1, name2):
    combined = name1 + name2
    combined = combined.lower()

    word1 = "true"
    word2 = "love"

    count1 = []

    for i in word1:
        if i in combined:
            count1.append(combined.count(i))

    x = sum(count1)
    x = str(x)
    count2 = []

    for i in word2:
        if i in combined:
            count2.append(combined.count(i))

    y = sum(count2)
    y = str(y)

    score = int(x + y)

    if score < 10 or score > 90: return f"Your score is {score}, you go together like coke and mentos."
    elif 40 <= score <= 50: return f"Your score is {score}, you are alright together."
    else: return f"Your score is {score}"

print(love_score("Kanye West", "Kim Kardashian"))
